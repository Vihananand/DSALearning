# Tree Notes

### 1. Trees contain three level:

### <ol><li>Root <li>Branches <li>Leaves

### 2. Normal Trees can contain as many child notes to a parent node.

### 3. Binary tree is the type of tree in which each node has only two child nodes.

### 4. Properties of Binary tree:

### <ol><li> Maximum nodes at level L = 2<sup>L</sup>.</li>   <li> Maximum nodes in a tree of height H = 2<sup>H</sup>-1.</li>    <li>For N nodes, minimum possible height or minimum number of levels are log<sub>2</sub>(N+1).</li>  <li>A binary tree with L leaves has at least log<sub>2</sub>(N+1)+1 number of leaves.</li>
