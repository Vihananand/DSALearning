# Queue Notes

### 1. Queue is a type of data structure where an item can be inserted from one end and can be removed from other end only. It is based on the principle of FIFO (First In First Out)

### 2. We will need two pointer to store the front and back of the Queue.

### 3. Stack has these important operations: 

```c++
enqueue(x); //push element in queue
dequeue(x); //remove elemnt from queue
peek(); //tells the value that is in front
empty(): //tell if the queue is empty or not
```

### 4. Queue can be made from Linked List and Stack also.
